# Tasks: New Quiz Play Flow for Students

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-new-quiz-play/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL - not explicitly requested in specification, so test tasks are not included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: Following Nuxt 3 structure with `composables/`, `pages/`, `components/`, `types/` at repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create directory structure for new quiz components in components/learning/new-quiz/
- [x] T002 Create types directory structure if needed for quiz attempt types in types/
- [x] T003 [P] Review existing useNewQuizApi composable structure in composables/api/useNewQuizApi.ts

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Navigate Between Questions and View Progress (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Students can navigate between questions in any order, see which questions are answered, view progress indicators, and see running score updates.

**Independent Test**: Start a quiz, navigate between questions using next/previous buttons, view question list with status indicators, verify progress bar and score update correctly.

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [x] T048 [US4] Implement next question navigation in pages/quizz/[id].vue (increment currentQuestionIndex)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories should proceed sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3) for MVP delivery
  - US2 and US3 can potentially be worked on in parallel after US1 is complete
  - US4 can be worked on after US1-3 are complete
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on US1 completion (needs quiz play page and components from US1)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on US1 completion (needs answer input component from US1)
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Depends on US1 completion (needs quiz play page and question display from US1)

### Within Each User Story

- Components before integration
- Core functionality before error handling
- Basic features before enhancements
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: All setup tasks can run in parallel
- **Phase 2**: Tasks T005-T008 can run in parallel (different methods in same file, but can be done sequentially or with careful coordination)
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: Some component creation tasks can be done in parallel:
  - T014, T015, T021, T025, T029 (different component files)
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: Tasks T034-T039 can be done in parallel (different aspects of resume functionality)
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: Tasks T041-T044 can be done together (all related to essay input component)
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: Tasks T048-T052 can be done in parallel (different navigation features)
- **Phase 7**: All polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch component creation tasks in parallel (different files):
Task: "Create NewQuizQuestion component in components/learning/new-quiz/NewQuizQuestion.vue"
Task: "Create NewQuizAnswerInput component in components/learning/new-quiz/NewQuizAnswerInput.vue"
Task: "Create NewQuizTimer component in components/learning/new-quiz/NewQuizTimer.vue"
Task: "Create NewQuizProgress component in components/learning/new-quiz/NewQuizProgress.vue"
Task: "Create NewQuizResults component in components/learning/new-quiz/NewQuizResults.vue"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
   - Start quiz from listing page
   - Answer MCQ and text-input questions
   - See immediate feedback
   - Submit quiz
   - Verify timer works for timed quizzes
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Resume capability)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Essay support)
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Navigation & Progress)
6. Add Polish → Final polish → Production ready
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (core functionality)
   - Developer B: Can help with US1 component creation in parallel
3. After US1 is complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (resume)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (essay) - can be done in parallel
4. After US2 and US3:
   - Developer A: User Story 4 (navigation)
   - Developer B: Polish tasks
5. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- All tasks include exact file paths for clarity
- Follow existing patterns from `pages/learning/quiz/[id]/index.vue` but adapt for new quiz system
