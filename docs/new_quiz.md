# New Quiz Management API Documentation

## Overview

The New Quiz Management system provides comprehensive quiz functionality **independent of courses/lessons**. Quizzes are organized by **Level** (A1, A2, B1, etc.) instead of course structure.

**Key Differences from Regular Quiz:**
- ✅ Organized by **Level** (not category/lesson/chapter)
- ✅ **Independent** of course structure
- ✅ All quiz features: MCQ, text input, essay questions
- ✅ Auto-grading + manual grading
- ✅ Retake limit, time limit, attempts tracking
- ✅ Comments, leaderboard, dashboard
